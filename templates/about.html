        <h1>THE MONTY HALL PROBLEM</h1>
        <p>The Monty Hall problem, named after the host of the American television game show "Let's Make a Deal,"
            has captivated mathematicians, statisticians, and enthusiasts since it emerged.
            Despite its apparent simplicity, this probability puzzle defies intuition and challenges our understanding of chances.

        <h1 class="revealUp"> The Game </h1>
        <h2 class="revealUp">Here’s how it works: 
        </h2>
        <h3 class="revealUp">There are 3 doors, two of them with a goat behind it, one with a car. 
        </h3>
        <img class="revealUp" style="max-width:800px" src="/intro1.png" />

          <div class="revealUp">
          <h3> The contestant picks whatever door they think might have the car</h3> 
            <img  style="max-width:800px" src="/intro2.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="revealUp">

            <h3>
         The host opens a door with a goat, thus eliminating one losing door
            </h3>
          <img  style="max-width:800px" src="/intro3.png" />
        </div>

        <div class="revealUp">

          <h3>
    The contestant is given the option to switch to the other unopened door or to stay with the chosen door
          </h3>
        <img  style="max-width:800px" src="/intro4.png" />

    </div>

        <p class="revealUp">At this point, most of us would probably just go with out gut feeling or even be inclined to stay with our initial choice. That's not be a good strategy, however, if you want the odds to stay in your favour.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section bg2" style="color:white;">
        <h1 class="revealUp">A Question from a Reader</h1>
        <p class="revealUp">In 1990, a reader submitted the following question to the magazine "Parade" asking their inhouse genius, Marilyn Von Savant:</p>
        <img class="revealUp" src="/question.png" />
        <p class="revealUp">So, in short, does it make a difference if you switch doors on "Let's Make a Deal"?
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section bg3" style="color:white;">
        <h1 class="revealUp">A Controversial Answer</h1>
        <h2 class="revealUp">Marilyn Von Savant had a somewhat surprising answer to this question: </h2>
       <img class="revealUp" src="/answer.png"  style="max-height:300px;"/>
        <p class="revealUp">Switch and double your chances, she told the reader. Her answer doesn't seem to make sense. With 1 car and 1 goat left surely 
            it doesn't matter if you switch doors? Logic tells us that each door had a 1/3 chance of holding the car when the game started. After the host eliminated a goat door, the odds must be 1/2 for each remaining door. Either your chosen door has the car or the other door has it, a 50/50 case? Right? 
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section bg1">
        <h1 class="revealUp">The Community Responds</h1>
        <p class="revealUp">Not according to Mary Von Savant, it seemed. Using her perplexing example, she claimed that your winning chances double if you switch doors.
            It makes no sense.
        </p>
        <h2 class="revealUp">This seemed to general the consensus and Marilyn’s answer generated a lot of heat</h2>
        <section class="quote-section revealUp" style="background-image: url(/static/quotes-bg.png)";
">
            <div id="quote-container-1"></div>
        </section>

        <h4 class="revealUp">(I presented my cousin, who is smart, has a master's degree and works with statistics,
            with this puzzle. He absolutely rejected it and I ended up letting it go)
        </h4>
        <h2 class="revealUp">Marilyn persisted, however. And, as the months went on, simulations were run and 
            numbers double checked and some very different responses began to emerge.
        </h2>
        <section class="quote-section revealUp" style="background-image: url(/static/quotes-bg2.png)">
            <div id="quote-container-2"></div>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section class="section bg3">
        <h1 class="revealUp">The Final Solution</h1>
        <h2 class="revealUp">As it turned out, the response to the readers question in Parade was completely correct- you should definitely switch doors if given the option. 
        </h2>
        <p class="revealUp">This bit of statistics is a counter intuitive as they get. 
            The fact remains, however, that the chosen door intially had a 1/3 chance of having a car behind it and those odds 
            stay the same throughout the game. The solution can even be calculated using something called "Bayes' theorem".
